## Git Usage Rule
* Always `pull` before anything!!!
* Don't modify other people's code.
* Open a new branch or directory if you want to do something new or make any significant changes.
* You can use command line to manage your code. Or, you can use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), which will be easier to manage if you don't have any previous git experience.
* Don't `push` any file bigger than 5Mb, you are needed to add `gitignore` in that case, if you don't understand, please contact Alvin Yixiao Sun.
* Other rules TBD...

## IDE, System, and Language Usage
* No requirement for IDE.
* High precedence for Mac, most READMEs are written concerning you are using mac or linux.
* We recommend you to install python2 and python3 with homebrew, most READMEs are written in that case, if your python cannot support you to follow the instruction, you are also recommended to figure out a way by searching by your self, or reinstall python with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). (In most cases we will add official links after every README, incase you may need help with different operating environments) 
* We will also use C++
